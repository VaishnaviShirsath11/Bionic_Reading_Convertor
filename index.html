                    Bionic reading is a reading technique that emphasizes some letters of words
                    to help readers process words faster and more efficiently. It 
                    uses artificial fixation points to guide the eyes through text by 
                    selectively bolding parts of words, such as the first half of each word. The brain processes words 
                    faster than the 
                    eyes can read individual letters, so focusing on fewer 
                    letters at a time helps readers process 
                    faster while still understanding the full meaning.
                    Bionic reading can be beneficial for people with ADHD or dyslexia, or anyone who wants to read more smoothly.
